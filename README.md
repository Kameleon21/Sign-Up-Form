# Sign-Up-Form

## Description

The aim of this project was to learn form inputs aswell as form validation. 

Some of the obsticles I have found while working on it was getting the inputs filed to display green or red depending if the user managed to 
match the pattern 

I have also tried to use **media queries** to make the form a bit responsive while viewing it on a smaller laptop screen
